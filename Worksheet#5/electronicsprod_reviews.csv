I have found them to be an excellent value for basic use - reading, web surfing, media playback and lightweight games.  I specifically do not use it as a laptop replacement or for hardcore gaming.  The 11"" screen is of an adequate size and the brightness and clarity are perfect for indoor use.  Mine has 128GB storage, which has the more useful upgrade of 8 GB RAM, which makes loading multiple programs much quicker.  There is a SD slot where you can add up to 1 TB, if you require it.The subjective speed of the A9+ is a little quicker than my older A8.  One useful throwback feature is that it has a real headphone jack if you happen to have a quality set of older headphones.  The built-in speakers are better than I would have thought - they are quite clear, but there is still no appreciable bass.Idle time battery life is somewhat less than I would have thought but this unit is still new and I haven't gone through that many charge cycles to sort out what is going on.  If you run the battery pretty far down, it can take a while to charge - about 4 hours from 10% to 100% using a Samsung phone charger."

It's a great tablet for the price.  It's hard to even find a smartphone as good as this for that price.  Obviously not as good as the tab S9 or S10, but for $700 less it's worth the trade offs like a lower resolution display.The screen is the high quality one you would expect from a modern Samsung device with rich colors and very bright.The only con is that 4gb of ram in the 64gb model is not enought for multitasking.  You're pretty much limited to 1 app open at a time or it will close the other app when you leave it because there isn't enough ram to have them both open.  Processor is also relatively slow but again, is fine when only 1 app is open at a time and nothing is updating in the background.Rating vs other tablets: 5 out of 10Rating as a sub-$200 tablet: 10 out of 10"

It was a very old tablet but did what we needed it to do. When it died, I found an Amazon fire kids tablet, which was not what I expected at all and though there being lots of things for kids, there was very little parental control I actually had and we could not download the apps we wanted as it's all through Amazon.I then ordered an android kids tablet and I had it set to return within a few hours of opening it because of similar issues. We could download the apps we wanted but they were different- youtube kids for example. It did not allow us the option to log in to the account we already had and would not allow us the option to show only approved content. It was preloaded with ""teacher approved"" content for the age range. It had complete brain cells killing trash on it. I would block one channel and 5 more would pop up. The layout and format of the android kids tablet was also very different from the regular android tablets as well.It was at this point that I landed on this Galaxy Samsung tablet and I am SO happy with this purchase! It is everything we need and were looking for! The size is perfect, the picture quality is great, set up was a breeze, it connected to wifi and Bluetooth headphones easily and quickly and the sound is great too! It has a fast speed and it all works great. It doesn't get hot and it doesn't ever freeze! The price is super reasonable too, especially for what you are getting.Bonus to this tablet and what makes it great for my son is that I can hide all the apps and basically everything on the tablet that I don't want my son messing with. I can make it to where the ONLY things he can get into or have access to are the hand selected apps of my choosing. I was able to log into kids youtube and log in with the same login we have on our TV and other devices so that saved time and allowed for my son to only see the content that I approved for him to watch. I was able to download a bunch of the completely free and add free learning apps (lucas and friends) and he can have the fun of screen time all while it being all learning- ABCs, numbers, learning how to spell, how to write, easy math, puzzles, etc.I wish I could go back in time and start with this tablet instead of wasting my time with the other two I tried out.  If anything happens to this one, I will definitely be buying again and recommending this tablet to my SIL for my nephew.  I can also use this for myself as well.I bought the following kid proof case and it fits this tablet like a glove and will help protect it from my 4 year old dropping it.  It has the front screen protector on it as well which will help shield the tablet from getting wet too if spilled on.https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLYCJZTH?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title"

Heat has been, is and shall always be the #1 enemy to electronics. Unfortunately, heat dissipation engineering is often underrated, overlooked and badly done, if done at all. With this setup, it never gets above 30c during Samsung Magician performance test. Base mobo temp is 29C.Before attaching the HR09 I removed the sticker form the M.2, the silicone pad from the HR09 and applied Prolimatech PK-3 to the HR09. The picture shows TF-7 but I found that stuff way too thick and didn’t spread well. I used Acetone and q-tips to get the sticker gum off the chip tops. The bottom of the HR09 is steel and really needs to be aluminum but the chips are on top of the M.2 so that is where the most heat can be dissipated. I then attached an NF-A6x25 to the HR09 using some nickel wire. I also needed to augment the foam pad between the M.2 and the mobo. Without doing these mods, it was as if the HR09 wasn't there.My tried and true method of applying heatsink paste that works perfect every single time, no fuss, no worry, and gives visible indication it worked and that the paste isn't old dried out beyond it's shelf life: Every heatsink is always a mm or two wider than the object it is sinking. Simply run tape down the sides a mm or two in from the sides and spread paste on with a single edged razor blade. The narrow thin tape on the edges act like runners for the razor blade to skate on. Hold blade at an angle, it isn't critical, between 10 and 60 degrees doesnt matter. Then peel the tape off. Apparently I didn't take a picture of the HR09 when I did that so I am including a picture of the CPU heatsink done in the exact same manner to give you the idea. They really should include some narrow, thin cellophane tape and a single sided razor blade instead of a uselss spatula.Great drive for a reasonable price. Very fast."

I’ve wanted an IPad for a long time now and I put in a lot of research as to which one I wanted and it is my very first one. First of all, it’s really just a lovely device to have, you can do SO MUCH with it. Second of all, the color options are really cute and as you can see, I went with pink. Third of all, the price point is very reasonable and fit my needs perfectly! The only issue I’ve faced thus far has been with the battery life. Doesn’t last “all day” for me. It needs to be charged after scrolling or watching YouTube videos after a few hours. I’m not going to complain on this issue too much however, because some of it has a lot to do with what I’m actually putting my device through. Such as the brightness level and apps running in the background and such. Overall, I’m very happy with this purchase! I cannot really compare with other models because as I stated, this is my first iPad. If you’re thinking of making this your newest addition, I would absolutely say go for it! If you’re a digital artist, get the pencil (USB-C) and go to town! Anyway, this iPad is just really fun and overall easy to use. I will enjoy it for many years to come hopefully!

A14 Bionic is impressively powerful, supporting efficient multitasking as well as handling top-tier apps. The display of the iPad Air is a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display that makes everything clear and bright making watching movies, reading, and even using the internet pleasant experiences.Having officially introduced the 64GB model, Apple hit the jackpot in terms of providing enough storage coupled with needed connectivity options. Storage of the apps, photos, and videos are more, and Wi-Fi 6 offers a fast internet connection. This is also backed by battery life of up to a full day or even days of work or play depending on the user.The Apple iPad (10th Generation) is a great product for a good performance and great functionalities finally. This is a great tablet, and among those that can actually be termed universal, the Asus Memo Pad 10 is the best you can get. I highly recommend it!"

The smallest memory size is too small for heavy users and there is a pretty stiff upcharge for the larger configuration.  New design has reverted to the square edged design language for the body, I prefer the curved body style (ie, 8th or 9th gen) but YMMV.  I don't like the camera bump, I only need a camera for FT so the quality that can be achieved with a flush mount is fine by me - again, see 8th/9th gen iPads.  Back to a wobbly device when laid down like on my iPhone :/  No Face ID is ridiculous at this point and the fingerprint scanner being located in the power button, while fast acting, isn't as handy as when it was easier to access on the front panel.The good?  It's an iPad!  New centered camera on the ""selfie"" cam is good for FT, no more weird angles. The speakers are now located on both ends of the device, not just one end, for much better sound quality.  USB-C!  Huzzah, it's now possible to be totally free of Apple's proprietary connectors.  Thinner bezel now that there is no home button.One more thing - iPads last a long time, I get 6-9 years or more out of them going all the way back to Gen 1 and I'm a ""computer guy/gamer"".  The oldest in the house right now is an iPad Pro 1st gen (2015) which is fine for an 8yr old to play Minecraft on and watch Netflix.  That one is no longer eligible for OS upgrades however, so it is ""old"" but for any normal use?  Works great.  I pretty much only replace them when software no longer is compatible, damage, etc. because there really aren't big changes anymore."

Expect high framerates and few frame dips thanks to high CPU limits, but with a few caveats.Pros:1. It is insanely fast and quiet. Balanced mode fans are around 40 dB (about as quiet as a desktop) but you can make them run much louder in Turbo mode.2. Good display. The 165Hz screen is quite good and fast, slightly better gamut then my previous laptop. The 16:10 ratio is also really nice for games and productivity apps. Mine has a slight green tint but only when using the iGPU, switching to Nvidia removes it. Which means it's probably a software issue (see ""Cons"" below)3. It runs cool. While playing endgame Dyson Sphere Program (basically a CPU stress test) the CPU doesn't even reach 80 degrees and manages to squeeze out 60+ fps where my old Ryzen 7 4800H would crap out and struggle to cough up 35 fps.Cons:1. Asus software is horrible, it's like it was coded by interns. This is the main reason I took one star off the review, out of the box MyAsus and Armoury Crate hog CPU and RAM and are constantly fighting against Windows' settings and each other. They can cause constant freezes and weird bugouts like the screen colors going haywire. Even after replacing them with G Helper, there are still a few lingering issues I have to be wary of.2. Bad battery life. Out of the box it runs like 5 hours max, 4 hours if you disable the screen battery saver (60 Hz is nauseating). Definitely going to need to lug that huge power brick around.3. The middle fan is very high-pitched like the ones you'd find in thinner laptops. It can be distracting for some, personally I'm on the fence. It is still very quiet and even gets drowned out by external speakers or headphones.4. Gaudy design. The lightbar is obviously annoying and the keys are pretty much unreadable without backlight on, which I really hate. The 4-zone RGB keyboard is also poorly executed, it looks patchy and has very limited color range. Typing on it feels very good though, it has full-size keys, high travel and good feedback. I just wish it had a numpad or a dedicated Home, End, PgUp and PGDown keys, there's a lot of wasted space on the deck.Overall I'm still very happy with my package, would recommend it to anyone who wants a well cooled laptop with insanely high performance with a tradeoff of portability and battery.And Asus, please fix your damn software."

I found my answer when I ran across this KYY Portable Monitor 15.6inch 1080P FHD USB-C, HDMI Computer Display.  It was a little difficult hooking everything up, the first time I used it; however, I am a man and reading Instructions simply isn't in our DNA.  Once I reviewed (not read) the Instruction Card, that came with the Unit, BAM, I instantly had TWO Screens.  I travel A LOT  and this Monitor now goes everywhere my laptop goes.  Although I haven't had it very long, I can assure you, it has been used and abused because my Second Office is on Construction Sites.  Now I am not recommending you go drop it out of a second story window or run over it with your car; however, I have to say that I am impressed with its durability.PROS:It's VERY Durable!Easy to hookup (if you review the card it comes with).Only takes a few minutes to set it up.The Screen is very clear and I can do anything on it that I need to!The Price is great!Its very light weight!The Case that it comes in also serves as a Monitor Stand.You can hook this up to your cell phone and share your phone screen.Great for traveling!CON:Volume.  Maybe I haven't figured out the volume controls yet; however, I consider myself to be slightly ""Tech Savvy"" and the monitor isn't very loud; however, its not really a problem for me because I just use the laptop's speakers.*Word of Caution:  When looking for a Second Monitor, do your research.  Make sure you purchase one that will do what you need it to do.  Some Monitor Screens are ONLY Mirroring Screens which means whatever you see on your main monitor, you will see on your second monitor.  This is NOT what I was looking for.  I needed a second display that would show other folders or Construction Plans, while I continued to work on another project with the other display.  I hope this makes since, I just don't want someone to purchase one thing, thinking they're getting something else, like I almost did.BOTTOM LINE:  I would highly recommend this Monitor to anyone that needs or wants a Dual Display."

Brand CUU 2022 newest WiFi extender booster repeater 4000 sqft- blah blah blah.  It was $2 more than this, the size of a pack of cigarettes, single band (2.4G) and only rated for 300mbps. I’m betting it came right from T e m u  or A L I E X P R E S S and someone stateside just ordered a bunch and doubled the price. That was a mistake. The ONLY job the extender needed to do was boost the signal for an Amazon Firestick that’s plugged into the back of my old tv that i brought into the garage i dispatch out of for work.  I work for a large utility company, and we garage out of a building thats an old converted airplane hanger.  We sit around in the morning waiting for our work, and then again at the end of the day when we do or timesheets -  so we wanted to be able to watch the news or whatever else during that downtime while we are waiting. The router is only about 70 feet away, but a hallway also separates it from the TV, so the WiFi signal has to make it through 2 concrete walls.  Without an extender the tv would constantly buffer, just stall and lose signal, or the image quality was horrible. Basically it was unusable.  We were unable to watch anything without it constantly having issues every few minutes.  So not being a tech guy - i bought (what i thought was)  a real cheap extender figuring anything would be good enough for ONE or TWO device connections.  The difference in build quality and performance (so far) between my first purchase and this model is huge - and this was $2 cheaper.  First off this is dual band, so it does both 2.4G and 5G bands. The 1200mbps rating (from what i understand) is the combined signal capacity, but you wont actually get that since you have to pick one of the two network signals its going to provide you with. So to be clear -  It actually gives you two different WiFi networks you can connect to (maybe thats beneficial to someone, i have no idea).  I know enough to know the 5G should be better.  I installed this via TP’s tether app (i think thats what it was called), and even for someone like me, it was painless. The instructions are very clear and self explanatory once you launch the app.  All you need is your router’s password, and obviously the name of its WiFi signal. After install and connection, youll get two more new WiFi signals that you can pick from to connect onto. One will say EXT on the end, and the other will say EXT 5G or something similar.  I picked the 5G to connect my phone and Firestick to.  Hooking up the Firestick to this was just as easy.  Whats cool with the app, is you can even monitor and control  WHO and WHAT is connected to the extenders network. So if someone else jumps onto it, you can block that device.  It’ll show you how many devices are connected to each band (they show up as 2 different WiFi signals on the app), what type of devices they are, and like i said - will let you block individual devices from being able to use the new WiFi signal. If nothing else itll be fun to mess with the other 20 guys i work with if they figure out how to connect to it lol.  I can literally sit there with my phone and turn their WiFi connection on and off if they jump onto this. But yea, what you get with this (a name brand unit from what I’m told) is leaps and bounds above what i just returned, and it was basically the same price.  I just hooked it up today, so its still early - but so far the Firestick is working fine on a 4K tv.  Picture quality is great, nothing is too slow to load, and most important the Firestick hasnt been buffering or had the signal stall out at all.  And remember - its extending a signal thats behind 2 cinder block walls with heavy metal doors - so probably a bit more than youll have to deal with in a house.  If it starts giving me any issues - i will report back.  So far I’m much happier with this then the last purchase. So happy i didnt give up and just keep what i first bought. Its hard these days will all the fake reviews for products - and I promise you this is a completely honest and no BS review.  Not that i tried them all, but youll have 3 different options on how to connect this to your router. I suggest scanning the QR code in the instructions, downloading the app and installing it that way. If nothing else it’s pretty cool to actually be able to SEE who and what is connected to your new signal.Edit:  Ok so its been about a month now. My opinion of this product has not changed. The Firestick/tv has experienced some VERY minor buffering very infrequently,  mostly in the morning when everyone is in the building (probably peak traffic for our router) so for me to claim it “never” buffers wouldn’t be accurate. Its most definitely not something that I would even attempt or consider addressing given my particular situation and conditions. Its not like I’m using this for anything important, i just wanna watch tv instead of listen to people complain about everything they can think of.  Our router is running half of our construction garage with close to a dozen desktops in different rooms just on our side of the building. Every tech has company tablets, so thats at least 20 guys just in my group alone that are splitting their signals between cell service and WiFi when they are close enough to jump on it. Just making the point our router is already handling way more stuff then anyone would experience at home, so some VERY infrequent hiccup on the Tv is easily forgiven in my eyes under these circumstances.  The day after thanksgiving we only had about 5 guys in, and we were held back in the garage all day just to respond to any emergency call that might come in.  I streamed the News, then John Wick 1 and 2 off Tubi with the Firestick and it was rock solid the entire time. I would not hesitate for a second if i needed one of these for home."

With this extender, the signal in my bedroom is strong and stable, even without plugging in an Ethernet cable. The dual-band feature (5GHz/2.4GHz) really helps optimize the connection depending on what I’m doing, and I can game smoothly without any issues now.Setup was quick, it covers a wide area, and it’s been a game-changer for improving the WiFi in my house.

El aparato es compacto, pero te ocupa todo un enchufe, así que piensa en dónde lo vas a colocar. Sin embargo quitando su largo, el aparto lo puedes poner donde sea ya que es delgado y las antenas se pueden acomodar.Tenía problemas de conexión en mi habitación por lo que la señal llegaba a duras penas haciendo difícil el usar el móvil en la cama y ni qué decir de una consola. Compré este repetidor con cierta duda, sinceramente no confiaba pero me fié de las reseñas y vaya que me equivoqué. Este aparato es increíblemente útil, súper facil de configurar, tanto es así que sinceramente no se necesitan ni siquiera los instructivos, y sin embargo los incluye junto a un código QR para bajar la App Tether la cual está completamente en español y es súper amigable e intuitiva. No te tardas ni 10 minutos configurando el repetidor, una vez conectado y configurado, lo puedes mover a donde te dé la gana. Mejoró de forma enorme la conexión, tengo la señal como si estuviera al lado del módem e incluso tengo mi consola Xbox series S conectada y con una recepción carente de cualquier tipo de lag, incluso hice descargas pesadas como por ejemplo Resident Evil 4 Remake y fue de maravilla. Inclusive me atrevería a decir que más rápido de lo normal, pero esto no lo aseguro como una función del repetidor. En resumen, si estás dudoso, compralo, no te vas a arrepentir y suele estar en buena oferta, yo lo conseguí por un tercio de su precio. Por ahora en su primer día de uso, estoy súper contento. 🩷"

I was a little hesitant to pull the trigger because of some of the reviewers on here saying they got a terrible renewed iPad... I can assure you that the one that I received was in overall 4.5/5 condition. The screen looked brand new, and even the rest of the body didn't appear to have any sort of defects. The cellular connection I'm getting (Ting Mobile, baby) is as steady as my cell phone (I was a little worried that the cell antenna in these wouldn't be of great quality, but I'm happy to say it is.)I've never owned any iPads, but recently got an iPhone and chose this over other tablets because I know Apple retina displays are actually very nice. Colors come across as vivid. Resolution turned up to the point where you're really struggling to make out individual pixels, and the screen is bright enough that I'm not struggling to see this in the car. And I bought this because I wanted a nice, big screen to look at when I'm in the car. One note about the display - it's a 4:3 display rather than the more contemporary 16:9 displays of the Android tablet world. That makes this about a ~9""-9.3"" display when watching content with a 1.777:1 or 1.85:1 aspect ratio which are the standard aspect ratios for films/TV shows (which is why your TV at home is a 16:9 aspect ratio!) Back to car use, the GPS works very well alongside cellular data. There are some cool navigation apps available on Apple, plus now I don't feel left out when there's other neat apps for Apple that I can't get on my Android phone. Also there are actually so many good accessories available for this thing because Apple has a small product line in comparison to the dozens of Android tablets and phones coming out each year from numerous manufacturers which equals lots of accessories with not so many reviews.I chose this specific model because it's the newest cellular Apple tablet at this price point. As of now, it's about 2-3 years old. The other ones I found on Amazon around the $200-300 range were as old as 8 years and without cellular, which is why I spent the extra money for something like this. I am happier than I was when I made my impulse buy which is impressive. You really do get a lot of tech for the money. A new 64gb iPad 10.2 with cellular is $459. This is only 32gb, and with a fresh install of iOS you get 23gb available to you. A little worried it won't be enough for me, but I'll probably manage.My only con so far is that the battery had a weird glitch. When you're in a high state of charge, it seems to be discharging at a slow enough rate. I got down to around 40% after using it for about 4 hours after using it to stream Hulu using cell data with full brightness. Then while using it with GPS on and streaming Spotify with full brightness on, it jumped from about 35% down to 20% within a few minutes. I can't complain too much because this is a 3 year old device about 2/3rds the price of new.I got mine from the seller ""techexchangee"" - came with a 5v/2.4a charger (or 12 watt) charger plus cable. Shipped in a plain box with lots of bubble wrap. Again, from the outside, I wouldn't have been able to tell it was renewed.P.S. On Amazon, I found a tablet mount for a car using a CD player and that thing is great. Highly recommend that if you want to use this in a car. It's the ""APPS2CAR universal car mount CD slot"" for $20."

One-day delivery.This monitor hooks up with my MacBook Air with a USB C Dongle. The picture isn’t that crisp but it is good enough. It functions great for Netflix, Amazon Video or other streaming services.It’s great for gaming. I have this monitor hooked up to my PS4 and the picture quality is amazing. I play Red Dead Redemption 2 and I frequently stop to admire the details in the water and snow. I’m not sure if this is due to the quality of the monitor or the game.It’s relatively easy to set up once you get it out of the box. It comes with a power cord and HDMI inside the box. There are 2 HDMI ports on the back so you could hook up a computer and another device.What I like about this monitor is that I don’t have to switch inputs from PS4 to my MacBook. When I disconnect my MacBook, the monitor detects the PS4 connection and automatically changes it. When my PS4 is off and I connect my MacBook the monitor instantly connects.The speakers suck though. They are quiet. They have no bass either.I paid roughly 88 dollars with tax for this screen and it was a good deal. Just keep in mind this is a 1080P screen so it’s not as good quality as a 1440p or 4k screen. Keep your expectations low. It’s a good secondary screen or a gaming device. It’s not great for photo or video editing if you want something with super high definition."

The color quality is not great compared to more expensive monitors tailored for gaming, but it is not a serious problem and it works great for the price. The best part about this monitor is the compact packaging and it is lightweight. You are provided with two screws and a screwdriver, which screws on the back of the monitor neck to hold the monitor in place. To disassemble, you just take out those screws, you can put everything back in the foam, and slide it back in the box. Then, you can carry the box easily under one arm. That’s why this is the perfect monitor for college move-ins/outs or anyone on the move with a monitor. I need two hands to carry the box of my more expensive Acer Nitro gaming monitor, but not this one. Finally, no computer monitor speakers are high quality, so don’t expect a rock concert coming out of any monitor speakers. They are just fine."

I ran it through a Passmark CPU benchmark and scored an 11,500 while attached to the charger which is quite impressive for this price range. I ordered this specifically for light duty use, and to replace a 14 year old Core i7 Dell Latitude that I ran HP Tuners software on to tune my hot rod. This Go 15 runs Win 11 Home very well. The first thing I did was take it out of S mode, deleted bloatware and other Microsoft apps that I will never use. After cleaning it up and updating it, I am thoroughly impressed with this PC, and how smoothly it actually runs. Especially since it was under $240 total with tax. The battery life seems great. I am certain it is severely lacking in battery in comparison to higher end laptops, but for what it is, 8hrs is excellent IMO. This is a huge upgrade over my old laptop, and I couldn't be happier with the purchase.Don't get me wrong, this is an entry level laptop for sure. If you game or heavily multi-task, get something with a more powerful processor and graphics. If you are a light user and want something that you can take with you, easily browse, easily stream video and hook up to a large TV... This will work well for that for sure."

Keyboard is nice to use.  Screen is bright and crisp.  Laptop is lightweight.This is NOT a laptop for gaming, video editing, demanding graphics work, and you're probably going to get frustrated if you are a busy, multi-tasker with multiple software and dozens of browser tabs open at the same time.That being said, for basic computing needs (word processing, watching Netflix, web browsing, blogging, writing a novel, taking classes, etc...), this laptop is near perfect and budget-friendly.Couple Notes: - The processor is 1.1 ghz, not 2.8 as listed in description, but really, you wouldn't be doing anything on this that should ever require that much processor speed. - Memory is upgradeable, which is nice, but I've found that 4gb is fine for what I'm using it for right now. - Laptop looks stylish, but lacks that ""high-end"" feel - but it's a $200 laptop.  Still, I like it and keyboard feels good for typing at length. - Screen is sharp.  Colors are decent.  Not the best screen out there, of course, but certainly not bad at all.  Not a touch screen...slight bummer but not a big deal to me. - Sound coming from speakers is nice and loud.  No, not premium sound, but sufficient to watch movies/video classes and hear it just fine.  I'm happy with it, but no audiophile.  Use headphones or a Bluetooth speaker if you want better sound. - Performance has been fast and I've been satisfied. - Easy to switch from Windows S to full Windows Home, which is my preference and why I opted for this over a Chromebook. - 81gb of available storage space after OS and apps take up a bit of the 128 gb drive.  To me, that's totally fine since I'm not saving anything on this - it all goes in the cloud. - I don't think the battery will actually last 9 hours with normal settings, but I get a solid 5 or so hours out of it between charges.RE: Slowness/Lagginess:A couple negative reviews mentioned this and when it happened to me, I thought that maybe there WAS something off about this computer.Turns out when I logged into my Microsoft account, it started syncing my existing desktop computer with this laptop, and with only 4gb of memory and slower processor, it just bogged it right down for about 20 minutes or so as it synced apps, desktop icons, etc....  Once everything synced up, it was fine and has been ever since.So if you experience slow, laggy performance when you first get this, and you've logged into your Microsoft account, set it down and let it sync for 20 minutes or so, or better yet, adjust the sync settings to be more selective.All in all, it's a great, inexpensive laptop that is super lightweight, super portable, looks nice, performs great, and is perfect for basic computing, an older child/teen, college courses, etc..."

S mode was turned off instantly and now i can download or search whatever website i want.— the CONS of this laptop:the sound quality isn’t the best.. and the screen quality isn’t the best either. is it doable? yes. have i seen better? also yes. also, this laptop takes a while to turn on, i have to hold the power button for 20 secs for it to turn on.-but anyways, i would recommend to anyone looking for a laptop on a budget!how did i turn S mode off? i wanted a new browser to use, so i chose google chrome. i went to download it, and it said something like “google chrome cannot be downloaded because this PC is in S mode” and it literally told me how to turn it off, it took less than 5 secs to turn it off. some other review said that they went through a lot to turn S mode off, so that’s why i was hesitant to buy this laptop, but everything ended up working out perfectly. i’m satisfied with this purchase tbh. i think it’s worth the money 100%."

I'm currently using for my PS5 that's shown in the picture.  The drive itself is very light weight.  I would make sure you give it plenty of space by your game console.  The cord it comes with is a Micro USB 3.0 and it is a good wire but it is short.  Transfer speed is great and it is fast.  Downloading the games from the Internet took me the whole day just to put on the drive but I was ok with that because I did have a big list of games that I wanted to put on this drive.  Do note that this only works for only Xbox One / PS4 games only, don't expect PS5 or Series X games to go on here.  It does feel very reliable, it does heat a bit when downloading or running games but it's not to the level of Overheating.  It is very easy to use and the connection is very fast.  You are using USB 3.0 with the next gen feature on it to make it run fast.  I have not experience any data losses on it so it seems very promising.  Overall I would recommend picking this one up and it is very promising.  It does come with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for one month so that is a nice bonus.  Always make sure to register your product to Seagate to get that warranty if something does go wrong.  Anyways that's it, it's a decent Game drive."

I’m able to play brand new games straight off the external hardrive because it is the same kind as the internal harddrive! It’s super portable, easy to install, and very functional.

Here’s why I’m impressed:Pros: Seamless Integration: The plug-and-play functionality is outstanding. Just pop it into the storage expansion slot at the back of the console, and you’re good to go. No setup, no hassle.Performance: This SSD provides the same performance as the internal storage, with no noticeable difference in load times or gameplay. Games load quickly, and I haven’t experienced any lag or performance issues.Storage Capacity: The 2TB capacity is a lifesaver for someone like me who loves downloading and playing multiple games. It effectively triples my storage space, which means I can keep all my favorite games installed without constantly juggling storage.Build Quality: The card feels robust and well-made. The design is compact, and it fits snugly into the console without sticking out awkwardly.Future-Proof: As more games come out with larger file sizes, having this extra storage ensures that I’m ready for any new releases without worrying about space constraints.Cons: There is only one Price: The only drawback is the cost. It’s on the pricier side, but considering the convenience and performance, I believe it’s worth the investment for serious gamers. Also there is a 1 Month Game Pass Ultimate code included inside the box that makes it a overall better value.Conclusion: The Seagate Storage Expansion Card 2TB SSD is a must-have for any Xbox Series X/S owner who needs additional storage. It delivers on performance, ease of use, and build quality. Despite the higher price point, it’s a worthy investment for the convenience and seamless gaming experience it provides. Highly recommended for gamers looking to expand their storage without compromising on performance."

The S Pen is a pastel, chalky lavender in a cooler tone.This tablet is razor thin, relatively lightweight for its size (perfect for drawing) and has a fantastic display.The user interface is typical of samsungs and androids. Unfortunately, Samsung phone themes are not compatible but you can customize the icons by selecting color schemes that match your wallpaper.Sounds quality is pretty good. It doesn't get too loud. To start, I played a mobile game and watched YouTube. Both experiences were hiccup-free and great on such a large, clear screen.The tablet comes with PENUP already on it, so artists who are just getting back into digital drawing will enjoy the app and its new, intuitive user interface.The S-pen has handwrite to text features that kick in automatically upon pairing with either your tablet or Samsung phone. I tried this S pen with both and the features come built into the pen!"

I have never had an issue with slippage on my previous xbox one controller but the texture is a welcome addition and it is very subtle which didn’t cause any discomfort in my hands. The Dpad now sports a similar look to the old 360 design but despite this it thankfully works like a regular Dpad and seems to be much more “clicky” now. It’s responsive and will work fine on platformers and similar style games though it would not be my first preference for fighting games. The only other addition I could spot is the share button which I understand is to capture games clips and screens. The analog sticks feel the same to me and the controller still requires double AA batteries although a battery pack can be purchased separately.Annoyingly, unlike my previous xbox controllers I was not able to get this working via Bluetooth on Ubuntu but connection through USB works with no issues so I just use it like that. I have tested it on a Windows 11 machine and the Bluetooth connection works as expected. Just make sure to select the section under Bluetooth devices that specifically mentions xbox controllers.The version I purchased was the electric volt that sports a two tone colour variant with a Kermit style green at the front and plain white at the back. Initially I thought that white would have quickly become dirty but after a few months of usage this was thankfully not the case. The grip texture strangely does not collect grime buildup which is much appreciated although I wonder what sorcery did they conjure to make this possible?Even if you are primarily a mouse and keyboard player it’s always handy to have a controller in the event you stumble across a game that demands it and I don’t think you can go wrong with this controller which can be had for <50 dollars on sale. I think it’s a perfect pickup if you need a new controller or replacement BUT If you already have a working xbox one controller I don’t think it’s worth spending money for this as an “upgrade” unless of course you really need that share button functionality. Personally, I think the PS5 controller wins the competition this round with newer tech like haptic and audio feedback for games that support it and that support does seem to be growing but that controller is substantially more expensive. You can’t go wrong with either but the core controller is in a much more affordable position particularly at sales prices."

The color is really vibrant!It came in the brand new Xbox packaging, Microsoft branding, setup manual and warranty/instructions manual and 2 Duracell alkaline batteries. Everything in the box is original and not copied from original. So, I say this controller is LEGIT!It has the USB-C charger port/data plug in the front. Nicely done! The underside of this controller has a textured grip to it which gives this controller much more comfortable feel compared to the older, smooth controllers. The sticks are snappy and precise and the buttons have a much stiffer feel to them as apposed to the older controllers as well.5 Stars and highly recommended!"

I Play on PC, and the game I first tried using the G920 was F1 2021. It took less than 30 minutes to position the pedals on my office carpet/ mounting the wheel to my desk and connecting cables. The SOFTWARE (Logitech G-Hub) for the G920 is very nice and simple for initially setting up your overall configurations for the wheel and throttle/brake/clutch pedals. It took me maybe 2-3 hours across about only 2-3 days to get used to my settings/feedback/calibration preferences, which was WAY quicker than I thought it would take. VERY CLEAN and responsive dual-motor force feedback. EVEN without setting the feedback strength to 100% in game yet it performs amazing. The G920 works likewise on iRacing as well! **BRAKE FOOT PETAL IS VERY FIRM AND THAT WAS MY ONLY INITIAL CONCERN FROM REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THE G920......HOWEVER!!!  LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE DONE, I SIMPLY AND GLADLY CHANGED THE BRAKE BINDING TO THE CLUTCH PEDAL CONSIDERING THAT IN F1 GAMES, THE CLUTCH IS ONLY USED FOR RACE STARTS/LAUNCHES AND IS NOT USED OR NEEDED FOR MANUAL PADDLE SHIFTING, (Bind set up works for holding the clutch while waiting for lights to go out to launch/start a race followed then by using the same pedal (clutch) for any braking done in game).- OVERALL.......THE G920 PERFORMS ABOVE MY EXPECTATIONS. I LOVE THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE WHEEL MATERIAL/FEELING/RESPONSE/ETC.....ALSO THE G920 DOES NOT HAVE A CHEAP FEELING AT ALL. THE QUALITY IS SUPERIOR FOR THE PRICE!!.... I PERSONALLY RECOMMEND THE G920 FOR ANYONE MAKING THE TRANSITION FROM CONTROLLER TO A WHEEL/PEDAL SET UP.  🏁🏁🏁🏁*THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON PERSONAL OPINION WITH PLENTYOF RESEARCH DONE BEFORE PURCHASING.*"

Well, I finally took the plunge and after first buying the wrong one (the PS version) I got this one when it was on sale around Christmas.At first, I made a crude stand for it using two plastic sawhorses and 3/4"" plywood. It worked ok, but wasn't ideal. Plus, we were finishing the room it was in and that setup wasn't going to fly. So, I bought an adjustable wheel stand. The G920 mounted to it pretty easily and it's stable enough to handle the most aggressive driving.As for the G920 itself, it's been great. I did learn quickly that you have to adjust it within the games or it can be more difficult to handle than the controller. I had constant oversteer in corners of Forza Horizon games until I looked up some tips on what input variables to adjust. Now, it works great. I've ordered the shifter. I know that manual shifting is dying out in real vehicles, but I still enjoy it and look forward to that addition in the near future. My only complaint is that  the USB cable isn't long enough. In my setup, it's hanging in the air when the wheel stand is in its position and its plugged into the Xbox. I guess I can get an extender, but haven't done so yet.The wheel and pedals are pretty well made and feel fairly solid. The paddle shifters work well and the force feedback is pretty strong. It has taken some adjustment on my part as when I used the standard controller, I accepted that it was a video game and wouldn't feel like driving a real car or truck. With the wheel, I kind of expected it to feel EXACTLY like a real car, but there is a bit of numbness--even though the wheel tries to transmit some road feel.As this is the only wheel/pedal setup I've ever used, I can't compare it to others, but I've been extremely happy with it so far and the addition of the shifter is sure to make it even more enjoyable."

Doesn't change if I use them.Playing any racing game the accelerator and clutch pedal are combined. Sometimes the accelerator will go up to 30-50% and I have to press the clutch to reach 100% as if they were combined eventho that box remains unchecked. I let it go a few months hoping it was driver related, constantly Uninstalling and reinstalling different drivers but nothing has changes.Worse experience I've had in a LONG time. Waste of money. I hope I can get warranties or my money back. So frustrating, so disappointing.***Update***After some rough customer service via web chat and trying to warranty the product and waited for the warranty email I had never received, I was sure it was a hardware defect and not a software defect.I found a pinch in the main wire whip right by the pedal assembly.  After rewiring the 5 wires with solder+water proof heatshrink, the pedals worked phenomenally!!!I do like logitec but it seems like their QC has gone south quite a bit. I had a $100 keyboard that lasted just passed the warranty as well as a g502 hero Special Edition mouse. I went back to my worn OG-502 and no other mouse compares...So about the setup... Finally aving some seat time on the PC with the G920 wheel, pedals, and 6 speed shifter with the addition of a USB handbrake..... the experience is u parallel.. it work from Forza to spin tires, it work with every driving game. If you like racing games or sims and don't want to drop over 1k for an indoor pass time or hobby but get great force feedback and a unique feel to every pedal. Then definitely gamble and get one of these logitecs. If you have a few extra bills to blow, get something better and I'm sure you won't be disappointed.***Update, a month or so after this review I found a fault in the wiring, I cut out the bad section and spliced the wires back together,  works great, great product. I bought my friend one as a gift after I fixed my own.***I would buy again. But I already did :)"

I’ve just started playing Sim racing game et Sim Trucking, and after a lot of research I’ve decided to purchase the Logitech G920 Driving Force Racing Wheels and Pedals. I was looking for a good entry point wheel, since I wasn’t sure I much I would like SIM racing or sim Trucking.I bought the G920 and the shifter in a combo deal through Amazon.ca! Received the product inside two Amazon Boxes which contained the Logitech Wheels and pedals inside  Xbox  green box and the shifter inside It’s on box.. All the parts were in plastic bags.I firstly noticed the quality material used for the construction, I was blown away by the hand-stitched leather covering the steering wheel. To a point that It smelled like in a brand new car! The and the design was way better looking then in pictures, That Same leather matching with the anodized aluminium and the center cap give an awesome look to the wheel And Not the forget the brushed stainless steel on the pedals also make this look and feel greatSince I don’t have a Sim rig, I’ve mounted the steering consol to my desk using the provided Logitech clamping system. Honestly, it’s not as perfect like if it would secured it to a Rig or cockpit but works fine for non-heavy uses. Meaning you can’t pull it too hard. But it still works fine ..I already had the Logitech G HUB program installed, and was automatically detected by my computer (windows 10) and I had not a single driver to install.But, once everything installed, when actually came the time to try this beauty,  I couldn’t believe the amount of force required to use the brake pedal!  Then it all came back to me, all those reviews I saw on amazon, on the web, in YouTube videos, when I was saying bah, it can’t be that bad. Well it is !  First of all, trying to apply enough force to brake, and my chair started to go backward .. then I tried compensating by gripping the wheel and it unclamped from my desk .. Even changed chair, using one without wheels and on flat wooden floors. The chair, and the pedal set where slipping. I found that for me, using it while on a carpet gave more grip. And later on I’ve made a wood frame to secure everything. *I know some people use the rig  mounting system to secure it to their desk, but I didn’t want to drill in my desk knowing I would get a racing cockpit later on. *Update: I’ve been using this unit for over a month, I’ve settled my games setting and now it’s now ok, getting use to the amount of force needed .Now let me talk about all the Pros , Switching from a keyboard or controller to this was a life changer, It so much more immersive.  You can feel the bumps on the road or even if your wheels are starting to slip in a curve and which allows you to react and get better times laps. The button layout is great, and you’re able to remap the button inside games to suite your likings. You can change the force feedback setting in the Ghub program, or inside most games. I personally didn’t adjust it much. In American Truck Simulator I adjusted the  brake to give it more braking power which reduced the amount of force require in general.It think that the button layout is good, but the middle button are harder to reach while gaming, so I map the button accordingly.Being new with the force feedback, man that made my gaming, racing expérience a brand new world, it’s so much more immersive.I really like the hand-stitched real leather finish which dosent give you that cheap plastic design. The finish of the wheel is awesome. the Anodized steering wheel spoke matched  with  the leather finish makes this wheel Looks and feel premium.In conclusion. I believe that this is a really great product! I actually think that you’re getting more then what you have paid for ! The design, the looks and feels, and the upgraded immersion driving experience, makes this a solid starting choice ! I totally recommend this to you!"

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k."

Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."

The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows."

If you're a MAC user, ""Stage Manager"" is a perfect companion to this large screen. It allows having multiple programs open but off to the side, so to speak. You can drag them on and off the screen as needed. The plug-and-play setup was easy, with no additional adjustments.My only complaint is the smaller print size. At the highest resolution, the print is smaller than on other screens I've used. Things get fuzzy on lower resolutions that increase the size of the print. To accommodate this, I use more accessibility settings on my MAC to enlarge and put bold elements on the screen. Overall, this is a good value and a good product."

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Video Quality: The Full HD 1080p resolution is impressive. My video calls look clear and professional, which is great for both meetings and streaming.Auto-Light Balance: This feature is a lifesaver. It automatically adjusts the lighting, so I always look well-lit, even in dim or overly bright environments.Built-In Microphone: The built-in mic captures my voice clearly, which means I don't need an external microphone for most calls. It's convenient and keeps my desk less cluttered.Privacy Shutter: I really appreciate the integrated privacy shutter. It gives me peace of mind knowing I can easily cover the camera when I'm not using it.Easy Setup: It's truly plug-and-play. I just connected it via USB-A, and it worked seamlessly with all my video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet.Cons:Zoom Capabilities: It doesn't have advanced zoom features, which might be a downside if you need to zoom in frequently during calls.No 4K Resolution: While 1080p is great, some might miss having a 4K option for even higher video quality.Requires USB-A Port: If your device only has USB-C ports, you'll need an adapter, which can be a bit inconvenient.Overall, the Logitech Brio 101 is a solid webcam that offers excellent video quality and useful features for both professional and casual use. It's been a reliable tool for my virtual meetings and streaming sessions."

I upgraded from a 720 resolution webcam and the image is significantly clearer.  As with any webcam, make the room as bright as possible, although this one does a decent job in low light.  Also like that this webcam has a narrower viewpoint than other webcams. I have a home office and want my image to take up most of the frame rather than showing the clutter around me in the office.Any external webcam is going to do a much better job than the webcam built into your laptop and it's not just about resolution it's about how it handles the shadows and bright spots.  Also, the built-in mic is much better than my laptop's mic.  Also, you can position an external webcam anywhere you want to.  Nothing worse than using a laptop webcam and having to look down onto the camera. By having it on top of the monitor, the image is much more professional looking.  I'm perfectly happy with this webcam but if I wanted better quality, I would get an actual photography camera that's designed to use as a webcam because I don't think you'd see a difference by just spending more on a webcam.Regarding the privacy slide on any webcam, yes it does work but the issue is that when you slide it, the camera might slide sideways Just use a small piece of cloth or paper and hinge it with a piece of tape and flip it out of the way when you want to use or not use it.I do give it five stars but did want to mention one criticism.  I wish this webcam had a tripod thread and also a ball socket to adjust the camera to any position.  This one only lets you adjust it up/down and not left to right and also a bit annoyed that the camera blocks the top row of my screen when using the built in kickstand.  Both of these problems easily solved by folding up the kickstand and using velcro to attach the bottom of the kickstand to the top of the monitor."
