The inner compartments are roomy and it has just the right ammount of pockets. I also like how not all the zipper compartments are obvious when you look at it. Some are slightly hidden. It makes it look sleek and minimal. The quality is top notch and it holds a lot especially if you use packing cubes for more organization. I do a lot of pet sitting for friends and I used to take a backpack, duffel bag and sometimes more bags depending on how long I'm staying and the bags I used just never had enough room. With this bag I can fit everything in it including my laptop and have enough for two weeks or more! I also wanted this bag as a good travel bag for personal trips and vacations. I also love the fact it was a decent price!"

This backpack is the perfect size for that and has just enough features. The quality is top notch. Not some basic Temu/Shein bag. Packaging is great. Comes in a branded box enclosed in a branded bag with tags attached. I would totally give this as a gift and be delighted if I was gifted one.I like the 2 exterior zipper pockets that I can use to stash my passport and boarding pass as I go through TSA or stash small snacks for easy access if the bag is under the seat in front of me. Love that the YKK zipper opening is u shaped vs just straight across the top for a wider opening. The laptop/iPad/tech zipper compartment is nicely placed so it sits against your back and has its own zipper (with ability to use a travel lock) so you can breeze through TSA. Trolly strap is a must and this one is sturdy. The straps are shaped well and are very comfortable. There is a chest strap. Carry handles on top and side. The padded back allows for comfort and ventilation. The only miss for me was that the main compartment lacks the same style lockable style zipper pulls as the tech compartment. It’s still possible to lock the pulls together but since you can access the tech compartment from the main U zipper compartment, this seems like an oversight. However, this is still the best bag I could have bought that wasn’t $200+."

This backpack was perfect. I could put quite a lot of stuff in it and keep items of different categories separate. There were plenty of zippers and pouches for everything. I love the 2 side pockets for water bottles. There is even a small pouch with a zipper the fits close to the back so is very secure- no pick pocketing allowed. It's perfect for a passport, small amount of money, etc. I didn't use it for my this backpack for my laptop this trip but the compartment was big enough for it for another trip where I usually need my laptop. The larger compartment was big enough to stuff a sweatshirt as well. It was perfect.  Since then I've used it just for hiking and since it's quite lightweight, it works great for that as well. The construction seems very solid and the zippers work great. I highly recommend this backpack for these types of needs. If I needed to carry a lot of heavy books, I'm not sure this backpack would have been the best choice- I think a heavier, more heavy-duty one would be better. But I wasn't wanting a heavy backpack for books, so it was perfect for me. A heavy one would not have been good for hiking, etc. So if you're wanting a light-weight but durable backpack, this is the one for you!"

I ordered 3 different bags and kept this one.This pack met all my needs, but it is definitely a HUGE backpack.  It has more pockets than you could imagine, has a huge capacity, the blue color and material are really nice.

The zippers have stayed intact and there has been no signs of wear. My only complaint at this point is that if you completely fill the backpack, it will not fit under a small (normal) airplane seat. I had to remove my jacket and purse from the backpack + remove the drink I had in the side mesh pocket in order to get it to fit. Kind of a bummer, but I’ll definitely get a lot of use out of this backpack regardless. Just know that you won’t be able to stuff it and still get it to fit under the seat.I have had the smaller version of this backpack for over 3 years and it has held up through a ton of travel (like I spent more time in airports than I spent at home kind of travel) and through me filling it way past capacity. Not a single zipper has broken and it barely has any signs of wear. I tried putting a keyboard and a larger 17"" laptop in there and was super bummed when they didn't fit.I was SO excited to find out that there's a 17"" version of the backpack I've loved since March 2021 and I immediately bought it, even though the price was a bit steep. For reference, I bought the smaller one for $22 and this one was $42.89. I received it today and it looks pretty much the same. Here's the side by side comparison:- (PRO) The 17"" bookbag has all the same compartments/pockets/you-name-its as the 15.6"" bag. It has a spacious pocket/compartment for everything you could possibly need to pack but it's not so spacious that it's bulky. Even the larger version seems like a good size for shoving under an airplane seat.-(PRO) Both sizes have this but I think it's worth mentioning. I've seen a lot of bookbags with fabric pockets on either side and I'm here to say that those are a dealbreaker for me. As a frequent traveler, I use those pockets for drinks, both large (large can of sparkling water or a 1 liter bottle) and small. The fabric pockets don't have any give and I am usually not able to get a drink in there. The stretchy mesh pockets that this bookbag has is *chefs kiss* perfection.- (PRO) The section that your laptop goes in zips all the way down on the larger/17"" version. No more digging through a completely packed bookbag for that small item I carelessly tossed in the bottom. My 15.6"" laptop bag doesn't have that feature and I didn't know I needed it.-(CON) The front horizontal pocket on the small version is 10.5"" deep (goes all the way to the bottom of the backpack) and the large version is 6.5"" deep. I would've liked to have the deeper pocket on the larger backpack but it will still work fine for what I need.-(CON and this is a major one) Right out of the packaging, it was obvious that there is a major difference in zipper quality between these two backpacks. I took the plastic off of the 17"" backpack and the zipper on the hidden pocket (the pocket that goes against your back) was zipped shut but was open in the middle. I fixed it for now but I'm not confident that it will hold up. I definitely won't be trusting that pocket with my passport or money, which is what it was meant for. The zipper in the front pocket where your phone, pens, etc go was doing the same thing and the zipper is noticeably smaller than the one on my 15.6"" laptop.  This is a big one and if any of the exterior zippers do this again, I'll be returning it.I'll be traveling in a week and will give it a go with the larger size backpack but I'm bringing my smaller one just in case the entire thing breaks loose and I find myself picking up all of my stuff from the floor in the TSA line. *cue panic attack* Will update my review afterwards."

Once she saw mine, she wanted one. Had ordered her a different style and color, which I’d thought would be a better fit for her needs. Amazon filled the order, and not only shopped a totally different style but also color. I’d ordered a pretty light blue because the pink in that company’s suitcase style backpack was a gaudy neon pink, the color they shipped was an ugly brownish grey. She was very disappointed, but is such a good kid would have kept it so I wouldn’t feel bad. Her dad is the one who told me. So I ordered her this pink backpack. It’s arrived and she is much happier. Funny that a 14 year old kid wanted a copy of the same backpack her 78 year old grandma has. As for the ugly one, my husband is happier to carry that color around than a pink one.As for Amazon substituting a completely different style and color for something that was a gift without first letting me know, I am not pleased with them at all.Update:  Used this backpack on a recent flight to visit family. It was exactly what we needed. Flew American Airlines, and it fit under the seat in front of me. It was full but not stuffed.  I put it where the bottom faced toward the front of the plane and the handle at the top of the backpack faced me. That way it was easy to grab hold of and pull out from under the seat. I put a bunch of clothes in a packing cube on the bottom of the backpack with toiletries in 2 zip lock bags plus my purse on top, near the handle. That left my electronics, papers, tickets, ID, and some basic purse type stuff in the zippered pocket in front. Everything fit well, and the packed backpack was much lighter and more comfortable to carry than my previous backpack. Plus it fit under the seat better. As for the pink getting dirty, the little bit that was on it wiped right off.Also, when I showed how this new backpack opens to our 14 and 15 year old granddaughters, they both wanted one. So I ordered a couple more for them. They each travel to their other parent’s homes whenever there is a school break, and like how much easier it will be to access things in the larger storage area. Plus they can pack more clothes. Also, both go out of town occasionally for sports events and these will be great for those times. I don’t think they will keep there regular backpacks for school, and use these for overnights with friends and traveling. I also showed my backpack to a couple of adults, and they were as equally impressed.Favorite feature is it opens like a suitcase. Provides so much more usable space that way. And so much easier to access. Least favorite feature is the zip area for electronics could be better designed and have a little more protective padding. It could have had better pocket design to hold purse type items, to help eliminate the need to also carry a purse. My old backpack has a much more practical design for that, even though it provides about the same amount of space. Also, the inner pockets are done with cheaper quality materials.That said, I still prefer this one. It can easily be adjusted to my 5’2” frame, is lighter in weight which my 78 year old body appreciates, opens up completely so easier to put my packing cubes in, easier for airport security to search if necessary, easier to adjust the items inside and secure so they don’t all slide to the bottom, and the color scheme will make it easier to identify if included with a bunch of other pieces of luggage. My 80 year old husband even admits that he will be willing to carry it for me as it isn’t really “pink” but more a beige color.  If our granddaughter’s didn’t already have a lot of backpacks, I would have ordered them each one. Yes, I definitely recommend it."

I purchased this one in part because it will fit my 17"" laptop, but also because I needed something to replace my old and ratty ""day to day"" backpack for ""urban schlepping.""  By and large, this is one very sturdy, spacious and versatile backpack, perhaps the best one I've ever bought. It arrived at my place of work with a whole bunch of other stuff I had ordered on Amazon; for the trip home, I was able to stuff my old (partially filled) backpack into it, along with two packaged tablecloths, two shower curtain liners, and several other smaller items--it all fit very easily with little packing effort expended. Two days later I fit 25 lbs of groceries into it, again with ease, and with room to spare--didn't even need the zippered side pockets, but I probably could have put another couple pounds worth of stuff in them. Both times, both trips, I found that the loaded pack rode very nicely, very comfortably near the center of my back, and that was without having yet made any adjustments to the straps. The cushioning on the back-facing side of the backpack is generous but not overly so, and yeah, the ""airflow"" feature between the two cushioned areas does seem to aid in the comfort factor. The straps are amply wide, also padded, and they have a measure of elasticity to them--near the top of each strap is a trapezoidal-shaped (2x2x3) of sturdy, ""one way"" stretch material (stretches vertically, not horizontally); when carrying the groceries, the pack didn't ""bounce around"" or anything, but the elastic acted like a shock absorber of sorts, made for flexibility in movement and kept the top of the straps from digging into my shoulders as other backpacks with heavy loads have done in the past. Overall, the main material is thick and obviously strong, the exterior front pockets are conveniently, smartly placed; the zippers are all seem very strong and reliable; and the stitching of the seams and strap connections appears to be very solidly done. When first looking at this bag, I thought I might be put off by the solid plastic handle at the top of the front compartment--never had bag with one of those--but I've already come to appreciate it: while on the subway I had to take the pack off and carry it by the handle and it allowed for a very good and solid grip, like carrying piece of luggage; also, while wearing the pack the handle doesn't interfere with my head movements at all like I thought it might--doesn't even come near my head. If I have any complaints at all, I'd say I'd prefer that the ""organizer pocket"" on the bottom front to have a bit stiffer accessory sleeve within (where you put pens and whatnot), but I'm sure I can deal with what's there, or perhaps I'll  invest in a small organizer or ""catchall"" to slip in there. Folks, this is a real good back pack; it might be overkill if you're looking for something just to carry a few light items all the time, but if you need something that will stand up to the regular (or even occasional) heavy load, or to maybe use as a carry on travel bag, this sucker is it.Just as a side note, perhaps to illustrate how sturdy this bag is:  A few days after getting the backpack, I was watching a 60 Minutes segment on ""Gorilla Doctors,"" veterinarians who traipse deep into the jungle to aid gorillas in peril. While in the field attending one anesthetized gorilla who had been snared, they show the vets unpacking their gear and medicines and whatnot . . . and the lead vet had what appeared to be this exact backpack. So, if jungle docs have confidence in this bag . . . go for it."

What I love about this backpack is the organization and pockets.  The ScanSmart feature is great!  I've gone through airport security so much quicker by zipping open the compartment and laying the bag on the belt with my laptop in the 'screen' side and my iPad in the facing pocket.  No hassles from TSA. No more pulling laptops or iPads out and then having to retrieve them and shove them back in while putting on shoes and belts.  It sounds like such a small thing but it makes me happy to be more efficient.  There are plenty of compartments and they can store so much stuff.  The 'main' compartment has dividers that allow you to organize your contents (I put my GoGrid in one of the slots, file folders in another.  There is also a mesh pocket that I store my MacBook Air 'brick'.  What this does is rather then sitting in the bottom of the bag and weighing it down, it sits in this suspended pocket which helps with the weight of the bag.  When I'm in a pinch and am exceeding the carryon limit, I can even get my medium sized Coach purse in so I can meet the 'two item limit'.  There are two side pockets for water bottles or a travel umbrella as well as another pocket that lays under them which the manufacturer suggests storing the power brick.  I find that if you've got a full water bottle, you probably would want to stay away from storing a bulky item in that pocket.  There's another 'kangaroo' pocket on the front of the pack to store small odds and ends.  I put my Bose noise canceling headphones in here which makes them easily accessible when I want to get to them and keeps them out of the way.  I like the heavy duty grab handle on the top of the bag which is convenient when you just need to grab and go.  There's an MP3 pocket with a headphone feed which I don't use but for those folks who do, I'm sure it's a nice feature.  The material is very high quality and heavy duty as are the zippers and clips.  It's a well thought out bag.I'm giving this 5-stars because it is such a great backpack but beware...it is VERY large and a bit on the weighty side even when empty.  I will admit that even when I've loaded it up for my daily commute on BART, it doesn't feel nearly as heavy as my previous 'trim' backpack because the ScanSmart is so well designed.  I do get comments from my co-workers who make fun of my massive backpack but I don't care because it does the trick. For my Europe vacation later this summer, this backpack will be staying home because it is way too big to be used as a daypack and we have strict size limits on what we can take on our tour (I have bought the PacSafe Metrosafe 350 which I will review after my trip).  Great product, nice pockets and organizational features."

My backpack fits into that category.  I use it everyday.  But, somehow this item had slipped past my radar.  Without thinking much of it, I found myself frustrated day after day with the biggest piece of crap backpack known to man.It wasn't balanced right.  When I would throw it over one shoulder, it would always want to slide down onto my arm.  The strap was angled wrong or positioned wrong or something...maybe it was because the material was slick.  I don't know what the problem was I just know that it just wasn't right and it was super annoying.  I was always carrying my water bottle in my hand because there wasn't a good place for it in my backpack.  It wasn't designed to protect my laptop well.  Sometimes, when I would set it down, I could hear my laptop make a thump sound as it hit the ground.  So, I put a small hand towell in the bottom to provide some cushion.  Sometimes, I needed to carry more stuff than what would fit and I was often frustrated that it wouldn't carry more.Finally, one day back in November (8 months ago) while on vacation, I happened to read a blog post by Timothy Ferriss in which he mentioned how happy he was with his innovative new Everyday Backpack by Huckberry.  That's when it hit me and I had this epiphany ""dude...you should get a better backpack!""  When the thought hit me, I realized how much I hated mine and was willing to pay practically anything for something better.I reviewed the one Tim recommended by Huckberry but I wasn't convinced that it was the right style for me.  So, I continued shopping.  I literally spent hours and hours shopping online.  I read reviews and zoomed in on the photos.  There are SO many backpacks!  I narrowed the list down to a half dozen or so but I just couldn't tell which was best.  It was so hard to tell by looking at the photos.  How could I know by looking at a photo if it was going to slide off my shoulder?  Finally, I was like ""dude...you're on vacation in one of the most beautiful places in the world with your family and you've wasted the whole morning shopping for a backpack.  This is stupid.""  So, I decided to do something I have never done before.  I ordered them all!  I decided to try them out, keep the best, and return all the rest.I spent $1,400 on backpacks!!  Since it was near Christmas time, all of them had a return policy that gave me till January 31 to return the item.  So, I used each one for a week and then I would retire it and try another.  Switching all my crap from one backpack to the next each time was a real pain.  And, trying to remember where I put everything so I could find it when I needed it was a hassle.  But, boy was it worth it because that's how I discovered this Nomatic backpack.When I first saw the Nomatic backpack online, I didn't really think this would be the one for me.  I spent $394 on the Huckeberry one alone and, for that price, I really expected that one to be the best quality and my clear favorite.But, after using the Nomatic for a week, I had a real, real hard time switching to the next one.  You've never seen a person more excited about a backpack in your life.  I spent the money on all these backpacks so I was determined to follow my plan and try a new one each week; I wanted to give each one a fair shake.  But, it was a bit painful because, after using the Nomatic, nothing else was even close.  I just couldn't wait to finish my test and go back to the Nomatic.At the end of my trial period, I finally boxed up the backpacks and sent them all back except the Nomatic.  I've been using the Nomatic for 6 months now and I truly can't say enough about how much I love it.  I literally comment to my wife all the time about how much I love this backpack.  The amount of joy it brings me is really out of whack.  I don't know how to explain it.  The only thing I can figure is that, perhaps, it's because of the immense frustration that I felt daily (without really realizing it) from my old crappy backpack that makes me appreciate this one so much.Every time I grab it and throw it over my shoulder, I just feel great.  It never slides off.  It's SO much more comfortable to carry than all the others.  The material is high quality and it's just designed right.Side by side, this Nomatic looks 10 times sexier than all the others.  Sometimes, when I go to church (not that I'm trying to look sexy at church...just sayin), I slide the shoulder straps into the convenient slot and carry it like a briefcase and it looks cool.  But, more important that the appearance, I love that it is so functional.I love that my two large, 32-ounce water bottles fit perfectly in the sides (now my hands are free!  What a concept!).  These bottles wouldn't fit in most of the other backpacks I tried.I love the way it holds my iPad Pro and my MacBook Pro.  It protects them both very well and they're both easily accessible.  It's water proof too so I feel better knowing that my electronics and other things are going to be safe and dry.I really LOVE that it is expandable to 30L when I need to carry more stuff.  LOVE THAT!  I can't say enough about this.  Before, it seemed like I was always out and about when I needed more space.  Like, if I bought something unexpected while traveling.  There I was...carrying bags in my hands because the items wouldn't fit in my backpack.  Now, I just unzip my Nomatic to expand it and throw my stuff into my backpack to free my hands.  Woohoo!  Wonderful!When I was shopping and purchasing all these backpacks, I wasn't sure what size to get.  I ordered two from Huckberry, the 20L and the 30L, and I was torn because, on the one hand, 90% of the time, I only need a small backpack but sometimes, when I need more space, I really need more space!  This one solves the problem.  Huckberry has one that expands from 20L to 30L but it's garbage.  They use snaps to expand it instead of zippers and they're terrible.  One side would often unsnap unexpectedly and then it was this lopsided mess.  And, it just seemed bulky where the Nomatic does not.  It's super compact when you need it to be and it's super expansive when you need more room.  Love it!I love the hidden pouch for stuffing cash when I'm traveling.  No more worrying about someone behind me unzipping a pouch in a foreign country and getting my stuff when I'm not looking.You wouldn't think of this but there are all kinds of different zipper styles and some work better than others.  In my old backpack, it took two hands to work the zippers...especially around the bends.  They would bind, get caught on the cloth, and just didn't work well.  Getting in and out of the thing was a pain.  The zippers on the Nomatic ROCK!  And, the material is firm enough that I can easily open and close it with one hand.  It's a small thing that makes a huge difference.  It's SO much better now.I got the compression bag, a tech pouch, and a bag for toiletries to go with it and I absolutely love having the different, removable compartments.  Now, when I need something, instead of digging through it and rummaging around like a woman looking for her keys in her purse, I just grab my tech pouch out of my backpack and boom...I'm there!  I grab the ""wash pouch"" that I got from Huckberry when I need my toothbrush and badabing!  Too cool!I got a battery pack to charge my cell phone when I'm traveling.  There's a side pouch for this that is a super convenient place to store it so it's out of the way most of the time but accessible when you need it.Oh...one of the other things I really love about the Nomatic is that you can unzip it completely on three sides and open it like a suit case to pack it or get to all your stuff.  With my last backpack, there was this small opening at the top and I was always digging around trying to find stuff in the bottom.  Sometimes, I would practically need a flashlight to find stuff.  So stupid!  The Nomatic, on the other hand, is so smart!I haven't used the waist band yet because I haven't needed it but I really like knowing that I have it if I want it.  Most of the other backpacks don't have a waist band.  I've been on quite a few high adventure backpack trips with the scouts and I know what a big difference this makes.  It takes all the pressure off your shoulders and puts the weight on your hips which is so much better.Well, now I've gone and wasted even more time on backpacks on a Saturday morning writing this long review.  I normally don't write reviews but my son is leaving to serve a two year mission for our church and he needs a good backpack.  When I came here to buy another Nomatic, I noticed some of the 1-star reviews and I was shocked.  I read many of them and it's such a shame.  There's always going to be some defect here or when stuff gets manufactured in a factory.  That's to be expected.  But, these negative reviews really do this product and the general public a disservice.  If these negative reviews discourage someone from trying this backpack, it's really sad because those people will be missing out on the best backpack on the planet.  Literally, I use this backpack multiple times each day and I feel a surge of joy each time I interact with it.  I can't say enough about how much better it is than every other backpack available.  If you use a backpack frequently, it's totally worth the price.  You're gonna love the Nomatic."

My Tumi for example was the bane of my travel existence.  Yes it looked sexy and sophisticated but it didn't hold anything more than my laptop, a passport and a phone charger. Any time I tried putting my drone in it or even just a set of clothes for the weekend, the zippers would literally come apart and I'd curse it's $600 dollar existence for being useless.  I won't even get into the aggravated spats I had with my $1000 Saint Laurent backpack.After years of travel frustration, I did some research and many fingers pointed me in the direction of this Nomatic.  I finally broke up with Tumi and gave Nomatic a try.  Wow, why didn't I do this sooner?!  This backpack is comfortable, carries everything you could possibly want for a weekend trip, looks sleek and expands when necessary!  The zippers are rugged and don't come apart.  I recently was caught in a rain shower and the zippers still work well and all of my stuff inside stayed dry.  I will never go back to another designer backpack again.  Nomatic traveler for life."

This bag has a hefty price tag on it, and while I find it to be excellent, the price is still hard to swallow.  That being said, it really is an excellent bag.  I got this because the backpack I used to use traveling finally kicked the bucket. Typically, I have always used a hiking pack as duel function traveling pack.  However, I travel via planes all the time, and I do worry about my laptop getting banged around too much.  And to be honest, I travel the skies far more than I hike.  This bag is perfect!  It easily protected my items while traveling, was big enough to fit anything I could want in a carry-on, and looked relatively normal (and those that have searched will know what I mean when I say that's not easy to find). I don't think this works great as a ""briefcase for work"" as they claim, but yes, you can carry it like one....I just wouldn't recommend an actual professional traveling on work to use it as such.  Just suck it up and get a quality briefcase instead of a pack to travel.  I just took my first trip with it, and was really pleased with everything about this bag.  The top pocket for easy cell phone and id access was a must for me and hard to find, every zipper for main compartments can be opened ANY way imaginable as there are 4 zipper heads per  pocket, and the padding around the laptop was perfect.  It also stands up on its own nicely, which was a nice surprise and what I didn't even know I would like.  Going through security was a efficient breeze.  If you need a pocket, this bag has one to accommodate you.  The hard sunglasses case was a nice bonus.  As for the compression sack, it's nice, but the level of compression is limited if you are used to other compression sacks.  That being said, I used it, and it did save some minimal space, and it doubled perfectly for holding dirty laundry on my trip as it has two separated sides to it, which was convenient.  Overall, this is truly an excellent pack...IF... you can deal with the price tag.  The upside, is this bag is sturdy, and I think it will last for many,many years."

We ended up keeping 3 out of the 6 or 7 bags purchased. Out of the 3, I absolutely love this one the most for its functionality/purpose.Durability: I've used this one for separate trips to Orlando, Mexico, Panama, & Europe. My teenaged son used one of the other brands on each of the same trips. While my bag still looks new/no issues, one of his straps broke somewhere between Spain & London - and I'm the one who overpacked!Size/Airline Concerns: No issues at all on Frontier (gag), Spirit, Southwest, AA, or British Airways... and remember I mentioned I overpacked.Favorites: I love the space, but the padding is what really stood out to me. I'm 5'0 tall, in my 40s, and this bag was really comfy to carry throughout our travels. When we have suitcases, it's easy to slide on the handle... but I absolutely love the space designated to hold the travel charger & of course the USB port.I also like there's ""just enough""pockets. My son's chosen bag annoyed him bc there were TOO MANY pockets and he was always rummaging through them all when he wanted to grab something.Dislikes: I do have a few minor dislikes...1) I found I had to be really cognizant of how I packed the main space if I wanted to pull things out of the bag while in flight. I packed vertically (if that makes sense?) so I wouldn't have to lie the bag down & open it like a suitcase - I could just reach in & grab a pouch from the top. I would suggest a divider, but that would take away from the benefit of a large packing area.... so careful planning, it is.2) I don't care for the cubes. I like the fact they're included, but I swapped them out for a better set.3) I just not in love with it visually. It's so blah. I *wish* I could merge the design appeal of one of the other bags I purchased with the functionality of this one!Despite my small issues, I'm still rating the bag a 5. The functionality & dependability throughout all of flights/trains/layovers deserves a top rating.I'm actually about to purchase another one now in black (to replace my son's bag with the broken strap)!"

As a college student it works well for holding my laptop and some notebooks, but in highschool when I carried 3-4 binders a day plus my laptop, planner, and pencil case, I don't think it could have held all that. Also, the front pocket only has storage space on the top half of the backpack. I actually like that feature because in the larger pocket of the bag items tend to slide down, so having the front pocket be 1/2 size actually improves the weight distribution. But that is an element that reduces size. Overall by far the most comfortable and highest quality backpack I've had, but not good if you're looking for a lot of storage."

I already started getting compliments for this bag.Difference of Three Pocket Bag and the rest:I was wondering what that meant before buying the backpack, and this basically refers to the main pockets, you will mostly get a similar size to the rest, the only major difference will be another compartment ( As you can see in the 5th photo I attached to the review ). I do like to add that for an extra 5$ from the Two Pocket Option for sure since I believe it is worth it to have an additional compartment to separate clothes/electronics/food from each other if I had to.This is by far the best backpack I have ever owned. Premium quality and attention to little details. It can be a great option for study or travel purposes, you will never go wrong with this backpack I guarantee you this for sure. I have always wanted a backpack that looks professional and can hold lots of stuff inside of it if I plan to for any case. This one fits all of the requirements, it'll always look good, no matter how much things you are going to stuff in it.Pros:I love that the charging port comes with a USB A and C type, this enables me to charge my phone without having to worry about getting an adapter. The first actual useful charging port I have seen :)This bag has the best and most luxurious inside material I have seen, it really feels good and seems like a premium quality material, not at all cheap.The outside material also feels very nice, it is definitely water-proof as described. This bag looks and feels professional, it is the real dealIn the last photo, you can see the hidden pocket. At first I was looking for it and actually went through the backpack twice until I found it, I was really impressed at how they managed to make it invisible to others!The zippers are really good and smooth, and the small handles are made of good quality unlike what other have been sharing in their reviews, I really believe they were reckless while using it.I like the small adjustments they added to the straps, one of them has a small pocket for cards and the other has a place to hang something on it, really making the most out of it.The main handle in which you can carry the backpack vertically is also made of impressive quality material, an outside rubber material that feels really smoothAnd let's talk a little about the logo, I really like the logo, it is so nice looking. This is something I care about honestly since it can affect how your backpack is going to look like to others. I dislike childish and colorful logos, but this one adds even more beauty to it.There are a lot of small compartments inside each pocket, this helps you organize more of your stuff inside the backpack and locate them easily when you want to use them.The back had that secret little pocket where I keep my important mails and papers there so nobody could access it easily until I take the bag off.It also has the additional small strap to help attach it to a suitcase while travelingIt is definitely made of breathing material that helps you sweat less in comparison with other straps materials.Neutral:One thing I personally like but think it could be controversial is the two side pockets. They go inside the backpack so you want to make sure you have some space in your last pocket since it could interfere with the space of these pockets. I like the idea of these pockets because I do not like by things to be exposed to the rest of the people, I like to keep my backpack looking sharp and clean.Also you are going to get the other hidden side pocket that I mentioned earlier, which you can still use.Cons:-The straps are maybe not the easiest to adjust, I usually have to take it off to adjust them, but sometimes I get lucky and adjust them without having to take the bag off, I do not think this will be a big problem for me.___________Overall, I would encourage you to get this backpack if it fits your priorities, the price is definitely a little expensive for many students like me, but I believe it was a necessary investment for me that will last for a good time."

This bag is still great.Original review:This backpack is well padded, lots of pockets, and holds up very well. I've been using mine basically every day for 11 months and it still looks and feels new. I'm not exaggerating on that. The outside material of the bag has a nice pseudo rubbery finish, so it sheds water well and is extremely easy to clean with a damp paper towel. I wouldn't trust this bag to keep water out if I wanted to go jogging in a rain storm, but for any quick in and outs in the rain, you'll be just fine.The only two gripes I have--and these are very minor--is:1. the little brackets on the straps that keeps them sized properly slip just a little over time, so they need occasional adjustment. There's a little loop strap to feed the extra length of the main strap through, and that does help some, especially if you snug it up against the bracket.2., the bottom part of the front, beneath the large front pocket, will crease if you use the front pocket for as much stuff as I do.I love the front pocket as its a little bit on the rigid side, which allows it to retain its shape even when empty or mostly empty. I can just pop the zippered flap up and drop stuff in or reach in easily to fish around for whatever I need.The laptop compartment is great, suspends your laptop off the floor and is well cushioned in the back. I don't usually use a tablet when I carry my laptop (which is almost always), so I just use the smaller slot for papers or odds and ends.The middle compartment (I got the one with two main compartments) is decently sized, though a little snug when the bag is well stuffed in the front and has my laptop in the back. I usually use this compartment for chargers, extra cords, etc.Both the front and middle pockets have mesh pouches inside, which is great for organization. I keep some sunscreen, extra toothbrush/toothpaste, and other travel toiletries in the middle mesh slot, and frequently used smaller things in the front compartment. This bag is great.The side pocket for drinks is nicely sized and easy to access. This pocket is lined with a water-proof (though I wouldn't want to test that if I had a choice lol), so you don't need to worry about the condensation from a cold drink leaking into the other compartments.There's a small ""secret compartment"" on the back for you to put important items like credit cards, wallet, etc., though due to it's location, if you fill it up overmuch, the pocket will jut out a little and won't be as comfortable on your lower back. With nothing (or very little) in that pocket, this backpack is VERY comfortable to wear.The stitching is also great, I habitually grab the bag using the right shoulder strap, as this is the one I use to slide it on or off my back usually when I'm getting in/out of the car. Once I realized I'd been doing this multiple times a day since I got it, I was a little concerned about how much extra stress I was putting on that strap. After a cursory inspection, however, you can't even tell that the right strap is used more than the left.The top handle is very rigid and tough. It's well placed and very useful for moving the bag around when you're picking it up.As I've mentioned in other places above, the overall build quality of this bag is incredible for the price. I'm blown away by how well it's held up with all the use I get out of it. The manufacturer knows what they're doing in this regard, not to mention the overall functionality of the design and aesthetic itself. I've gotten multiple complements on this bag, especially right after I got it.At this point, if anything ever happens to this backpack, I will immediately by another one right away--no hesitation. The best backpack I have EVER owned."

Rarely do I gush about things like this, but this bag is so GREAT! I love the look and durability. It has lots of pockets with sturdy zippers to stay organized. Very sturdy zippers!  Many pockets are in secure places but easily accessible for airport security. It fit under the seat on the plane, too. I really, really loved that I could carry it by the handle or like a backpack. No more duffle-bag shoulder bruises! It was comfortable on my back, too, even with a full load that included a kindle and a traditional book. The way the top opens wide is fantastic. It's like some kind of wild Bag-of-Holding! It goes down and down and down... I also like the choice of colors. I happen to love hunter green but all of them looked really nice, with no sacrifice in quality. There was also a wide range of sizes, which should appeal to anyone for any need. This is just a great bag!"

But when we had to evacuate to a shelter for hurricane Milton, there was so much to pak and it was difficult to find anything....This bag will make life easier for such events. I love the wide opening and that it stands up by itself, not floppy. Just a great looking, well made, well priced bag. 5 stars"

I was surprised by how durable it was given the fair price. The zippers are well made and don't catch. There is hard boning in the top opening to encourage a wide space for belongings inside. The inside is padded and water proof, just need to take a wet wipe if there's ever a spill. MUCH bigger than I thought it would be, I can hold so much stuff in this thing. I especially like the secret zipper pouch on the back of the bag-- a good spot for a wallet or medications that is difficult for a pickpocket to reach."

I have both a Tom Bihn Aeronaut 45L and an Osprey Farpoint 40 for 1 pack traveling (but also my Briggs & Riley rollers for when I don't want to carry a load). I have multiple hiking daypacks, mostly from Osprey. I have ""technical"" backpacks and slings and totes and probably too many messenger bags.Currently my two ""EDC"" (Everyday Carry) backpacks of choice were a Peak Design Everyday V2 at 30L, and a slimmer, no-name, cheap laptop bag that, frankly, got the job done. The Peak Design was a bit too big through as a true EDC, though great for traveling, so I wanted a slimmer EDC, because the cheap one was starting to fray, and the definitely not YKK zippers were starting to get stuck. After watching many a Youtube video (Chase Reeves, Packhacker) and reading various reviews on Wirecutter and elsewhere, I somehow stumbled on this Troubadour Apex, a brand I'd never even heard of. I did more research on it, thought it fit my needs very well, and finally pulled the plus when Amazon got it back in stock.I'd considered going with the compact version, but I wanted something that could fit my 17"" LG Gram, which, admittedly is about the smallest 17"" laptop you're going to get, but also an additional 16"" portable monitor. The Apex accommodates both easily in the laptop compartment, with a bit of room to spare. That laptop compartment also floats off of the ground by a bit, a key feature for laptop safety from the odd drop. I then also tried to cram in my work laptop, a 15"" (ish) Dell Latitude, in the same compartment, but out of the floating pocket, so encased in its own padded sleeve, and all three fit!The rest of the backpack is decently roomy for a couple of medium sized packing cubes and/or a tech pouch/dopp kit. I'd imagine you could easily fit enough for a weekend without a sweat, though I would probably favor the Peak Design on a multi-week trip. There's enough organizational nooks and crannies to pack away various cables, pens, etc., though I rely more on a tech pouch for my organization. There's an odd hidden sleeve that I'm guessing is for stowing passports or boarding passes, but I'd rather put those things on a sling or dedicated pouch.The Apex does have a very convenient luggage pass through sleeve to stack on top of a suitcase roller, and it keeps the backpack upright, unlike say on the Peak Design that puts the backpack on its side. Honestly, this is a bit of a key feature that eliminated other well rated backpacks, like Bellroy's various backpacks, because they lacked the pass through. But when on my shoulders, it's very comfortable, though I'll have to get back to how comfortable after walking a few miles across town, or running to catch a plane a few times.Finally, the bag is just cool looking. The overall aesthetics are stylish, with bits of vegan leather accents, including the zipper holds that I'd be comfortable bringing into any work meeting space. Having said that, this brings me to the one minus to the bag (so far), which is the water bottle holders, which are pretty small. They're good for a slim bottle, but my 20 oz Contago coffee mug doesn't feel very secure in there, and I'd rather give up a bit of that slim aesthetic (again, looks great on your back) for a deeper, secure fit for the bigger water bottles."

From the second I opened the box, the aesthetic blew my mind. I share this attraction with dozens of strangers who have stopped me to compliment my bag during my travels. I like it so much that I purchased 6 of them for my wedding party, who are all just as in love with the bag as I am.The Apex 3.0 stands firm on its own while empty, the profile is slim and sleek, the materials are structurally firm but soft to the touch, the straps are comfortable, the design is practical and the interior is absolutely elegant.I will say, it’s not perfect as I noticed a few minor blemishes (example, small gap in the waterproof zipper where the zip is located in packaging). I just wetted my finger tips and massaged it into place. Gentle friction, enough to warm it up. It was driving me crazy but the good news is the material is pretty ‘smart’ and it will take shape more as you use it.My bag has been on several trips with me; full day at Disney, carried for 30 days on two separate trips to Europe, tossed under plane seats, carried to the office every day, and it still looks and feels brand new. The picture in my review is after all of this use, almost a year later (please note, its full and sitting awkwardly in the first pic).In summary, if you want a good looking, versatile and trustworthy bag, think less and try the APEX out."

Very durable, packed with featuresI'm a who loves backpacks, especially ones that fit my exact needs. I travel around pretty frequently and always try to pack as light as possible. Always trying to avoid checking a bag when I travel and only using carry on's. This backpack has always been on my radar, but just couldn't stomach the price. Eventually, the little voice inside my head that's always whispering ""treat yo self"" finally got the best of me. And I took the plunge. It got here right before my 3 week trip to Europe.As soon as I got it, I was blow away with all the hidden features that it had. Peak Design is very good at not just product design, but also integration with its other products. I paired this with the small camera cube and medium size packing cube. The ideal set up for this bag in my opinion. I can carry most of my camera stuff in the camera cube, and about 4-5 days of clothing in the packing cube. With some room to spare! This set up leaves a small cavity at the top of the bag which I used to put with my toiletry bag or my Bose QC35 headphones along with a travel blanket. It all fits very snug and fits like a puzzle.The hidden straps at the bottom of the bag were way more useful to me that I really thought they would be. I typically travel with a crew neck or hoodie because airplanes are typically cold, but when I'm walking around or its warm at my destination, I'll take it off and use the straps to secure it on the outside of my bag. I've also used the straps to carry a blanket, works beautify and its very secure.The middle diver in the bag can be unzipped and folded away if you just want one big sack to work with, I prefer to leave it in place, has a well padded laptop and separate tablet compartment, and a few hidden pockets in the bottle holders. My only gripe with the backpack would have to be those afore mentioned bottle holders. I feel like they don't hold bottles snuggly enough. But given everything else about this bag, I can can't deal with it.The zippers are very solid, and water resistant, as is the whole bag. Personally tested this out when walking around Paris in the rain. My belongings were perfectly dry inside! Another big feature about the bag is its stow away backpack straps and waist belt. I always remove the waist belt of any backpack I get because I hardly use it. In this backpack, you can't remove them, but they do fold away behind some cleverly designed magnetic flaps! And when they are stowed, you don't feel any weird bumps and won'y even know they're there. You can also stow away the backpack straps under those same flaps and make this thing a full blown duffle bag. Which has come in handy more times than I would've thought.Final thoughts. Given how much I travel, I wish I would've bought this bag sooner. Cant recommend enough! The Value/Convience factor is just as high as the price haha. But well worth it."

It worked great on my first trip going to DC for a long weekend. I was able to pack 5 days of clothes, a pair of shoes, a laptop, a rain poncho, umbrella, a packable backpack, a hat, a shave kit, a mess kit, toiletries, a DLSR camera, a smaller gimbal camera, a journal, a couple of battery packs, assorted cables and chargers. It all fit without having to expand to the full 45 liters. I'm sure I over-packed it versus how Peak Design expects it to be packed. It still easily fit the carry-on size for my carrier. I also love how I don't have to lean it up against anything when I'm sitting waiting for the flight. It stands upright all by itself.Even though the initial packed configuration looked like it deformed the back, everything zipped up nice and easy. On top of that I could open it up from the side and slip in the umbrella, although it could have also gone in the extra large exterior side pocket. Surprisingly, even with all that weight it was super comfortable even without the waist straps. Getting it up and down from the overhead was super easy since the straps all tuck away and it has handles on 5 sides of the pack. I also made use of the loops to hook my headphone case for easy access.I used the Peak Design packing cubes and those were awesome as well. They open all the way up making them easy to pack and then can be compressed. They kept everything separated and had a nice extra pocket for dirty clothes. This was nice because I could leave my pack on the hook at the end of the bed, pull out a cube to get ready for the day, and stuff it back into the pack pretty easily. No need to unpack everything or worry about checking through drawers on checkout day.Since the bag butterflies open I was able to go through the airport scanner without putting my laptop in a separate bucket; It stayed in the padded pouch. Peak Design provides some internal cubes for cameras that are secured to internal hooks using custom carabiner/clips. I didn't need those cubes, but I did want some extra restraint for my gear all the same. I couldn't find similar clips locally, or something like G-hooks, or other straps that could hook on easily. I found some simple metal loops at the store along with some hook and loop elastic straps. A snip with some wire cutters and a little filing for the cut ends and I had an easy way to use the built-in loops and add some straps to further secure the interior contents. Could be overkill, because everything fits great. But I like not having to worry about things spilling out in the shuffle of the security line. I did end up buying some of the Peak Design clips separately after the trip and they're definitely superior to my little hacked clips.Everything is super easy to access on this bag; Front, back, and both sides. I like this configuration much better than other backpacks that have a ton of pockets and zippers and organizers that never get fully used for what they were meant for. This is simple and easy. Big pockets to throw your stuff into. Very simple organization pocket for common things or plenty of room to throw your own favorite organizer into.The only negative I have for this pack is that because it is so well built and well-structured it's going to be an effort to minimize how much I put into it to meet weight limits when traveling internationally. It's about 4 lbs empty which eats up a bunch of weight when limited to 17-20 lbs for a carry-on with many flights. It also just invites throwing everything into it for one bag travel.Really love this pack."

I don't know how I used my previous bag for so long. This bag combined with the tech pouch, wash pouch, and the 3l sling fit perfectly with room for my over headphones and a 16inch Macbook pro. All the organization and quick access made travel better than I have ever experienced. With the expansion capabilities, I was able to expand it enough to fit additional purchases made on the trip but still have easy access to my belongings. A larger bag but still got it to fit underneath all of our airplane seats. Once we got back my wife purchased the bag as well cause she saw how nice it was.The build is great, I got black and love how sleek it is. A phenomenal travel companion"

It seems well built and the various entry points are good. You do have to buy additional units to fully use this pack. Those extra units do help increase the flexibility of this item but they do add additional cost. I might recommend that the company add some packing cubes that allow for more work related options. A cube that would allow packing for work needs such as an additional iPad, the various cords and batteries and folders could be helpful as the front flap gets full pretty quickly leaving a lot of space in the main compartment that could be used with a differently designed cube.We will see how this holds up. Once I get it all packed up, it is HEAVY. I can take the strain, we will see if the backpack can."

Some thought it too small, or thought it looked bigger in the pictures.  Not I.  When I opened the package, I thought it seemed a bit small.  As soon as I started packing it, I changed my mind about that.  It took more clothes than I expected; and then some!  A pair of Levis; two changes of T-shirts, shorts and socks; two winter weight long sleeve shirts.  A week's worth of medicine; toiletries; some first-aid supplies.  That much just lightly filled the main compartment, with enough room left that I could add a bit more without a struggle.  I could have put my anorak in; bit instead I slipped it into the front picket where it is more quickly accessible.  Plenty of room was left for chargers for computer and iPhone.  They slip into pockets, just the right size--not just tossed in loose.There's room in those areas for small, medium, and large size notebooks as well.My computer:  There is a dedicated pocket for it.  I own both a 13  and 15 inch iMac Pro.  The 15 inch fits in it just fine, but I prefer to bring my 13 on trips; and of course it fit with room to spare.  There is enough padding, and what's more, the computer compartment is towards the front of the pack, not up against my back.  It's more comfortable there; and I believe, better protected.It's a well thought out design.  The materials seem strong, substantial, without cutting corners.  I believe a sternum strap would be a worthy improvement.  It is a splendid backpack.I may buy a second one, as a spare.  Or in case my wife decides she has to use my backpack, like she's done with my roller bag."

This backpack did it so well, she is still using it at college. I bought another one for the younger child who is now in high school and it is standing up well to the rigors of a teenage boy.Its organized well, with a well designed laptop slot for his chrome book, can carry all his textbooks and papers, and has a separate, easily gotten to zippered pocket big enough for his daily planner to keep him on schedule with his myriad activities and assignments. On the outside it has a good water bottle pocket and the waist belt, while packed away most of the time, is nice if you're running through an airport and don't want it to flop around. It fits under an airplane seat, and my oldest kids bag looks almost brand new after ~4 years of abuse. We'll see if the new one does the same, but so far its looking just as strong.They aren't cheap, but you do get a great bag for the price. My wife has an older Osprey backpack built on the same design, but with a different name vs Nebula, and it has stood up to almost daily use for 8+ years. Enjoy."

I have carried it with me every day since I bought it, I flew with it on a work trip, and it has been great.The biggest factor of course is comfort, which this bag isn't like carrying a cushy cloud or anything, however it isn't cumbersome and it has padding in the right places to make it easy to forget you're wearing it. I've stuffed it with clothes, 2 laptops, a bunch of electronics, etc. and while it does get tight, it still manages to zip up easily and store it all.The one thing I don't really understand is why there's one ""hole"" covered by a flap that seemingly doesn't really serve a purpose? If anything I'd see that as a potential entry point for accidental spills or rain or whatever and it leads right into the compartment where laptops go. I haven't had an issue with it but it's strange that it's there.Apart from that I don't really have anything negative to say. The zippers are great, and as much as I've stuffed it, all the seams are in good shape and it's just an overall durable bag. Also I wouldn't necessarily recommend carrying 2 laptops in it, although you CAN it gets quite heavy and I believe a bigger bag would be better suited for that."
