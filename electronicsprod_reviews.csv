And my Seagate still has a large amount of free space. Every device I plugged the Seagate into, immediately recognized the device and was ready to go. The file transfer speed was amazing. I am very impressed. My only concern was the included usb cable seemed a bit flimsy as far as the Micro B end that plugs into the drive. It worked fine but I was worried it was too flimsy and wouldn’t last. Easy fix, I just purchased a more solid cable. Very -.eased with this purchase. 5 stars"

I found my answer when I ran across this KYY Portable Monitor 15.6inch 1080P FHD USB-C, HDMI Computer Display.  It was a little difficult hooking everything up, the first time I used it; however, I am a man and reading Instructions simply isn't in our DNA.  Once I reviewed (not read) the Instruction Card, that came with the Unit, BAM, I instantly had TWO Screens.  I travel A LOT  and this Monitor now goes everywhere my laptop goes.  Although I haven't had it very long, I can assure you, it has been used and abused because my Second Office is on Construction Sites.  Now I am not recommending you go drop it out of a second story window or run over it with your car; however, I have to say that I am impressed with its durability.PROS:It's VERY Durable!Easy to hookup (if you review the card it comes with).Only takes a few minutes to set it up.The Screen is very clear and I can do anything on it that I need to!The Price is great!Its very light weight!The Case that it comes in also serves as a Monitor Stand.You can hook this up to your cell phone and share your phone screen.Great for traveling!CON:Volume.  Maybe I haven't figured out the volume controls yet; however, I consider myself to be slightly ""Tech Savvy"" and the monitor isn't very loud; however, its not really a problem for me because I just use the laptop's speakers.*Word of Caution:  When looking for a Second Monitor, do your research.  Make sure you purchase one that will do what you need it to do.  Some Monitor Screens are ONLY Mirroring Screens which means whatever you see on your main monitor, you will see on your second monitor.  This is NOT what I was looking for.  I needed a second display that would show other folders or Construction Plans, while I continued to work on another project with the other display.  I hope this makes since, I just don't want someone to purchase one thing, thinking they're getting something else, like I almost did.BOTTOM LINE:  I would highly recommend this Monitor to anyone that needs or wants a Dual Display."

One-day delivery.This monitor hooks up with my MacBook Air with a USB C Dongle. The picture isn’t that crisp but it is good enough. It functions great for Netflix, Amazon Video or other streaming services.It’s great for gaming. I have this monitor hooked up to my PS4 and the picture quality is amazing. I play Red Dead Redemption 2 and I frequently stop to admire the details in the water and snow. I’m not sure if this is due to the quality of the monitor or the game.It’s relatively easy to set up once you get it out of the box. It comes with a power cord and HDMI inside the box. There are 2 HDMI ports on the back so you could hook up a computer and another device.What I like about this monitor is that I don’t have to switch inputs from PS4 to my MacBook. When I disconnect my MacBook, the monitor detects the PS4 connection and automatically changes it. When my PS4 is off and I connect my MacBook the monitor instantly connects.The speakers suck though. They are quiet. They have no bass either.I paid roughly 88 dollars with tax for this screen and it was a good deal. Just keep in mind this is a 1080P screen so it’s not as good quality as a 1440p or 4k screen. Keep your expectations low. It’s a good secondary screen or a gaming device. It’s not great for photo or video editing if you want something with super high definition."

The color quality is not great compared to more expensive monitors tailored for gaming, but it is not a serious problem and it works great for the price. The best part about this monitor is the compact packaging and it is lightweight. You are provided with two screws and a screwdriver, which screws on the back of the monitor neck to hold the monitor in place. To disassemble, you just take out those screws, you can put everything back in the foam, and slide it back in the box. Then, you can carry the box easily under one arm. That’s why this is the perfect monitor for college move-ins/outs or anyone on the move with a monitor. I need two hands to carry the box of my more expensive Acer Nitro gaming monitor, but not this one. Finally, no computer monitor speakers are high quality, so don’t expect a rock concert coming out of any monitor speakers. They are just fine."

Will make a really good school or low level gaming laptop compared to latest games.It came with a 128gb 800mbps m.2 drive that was slow for windows 11 so upgraded it to 1tb 3500mbps m.2 drive. There are mixed reviews and info even from the manufacturer on if it has a extra ram slot or not but this one does not have one. All the ram is soldered to the motherboard and needs to be taken to an Acer shop in order to upgrade. Out of the box it used 6/8gb of ram at first then after the updates it dropped down to 4/8gb used. The system is pretty fast for only having 4gb free. The processor is the main feature I ordered it for since it is a 4core-8thread processor with speed ranging from 2.5ghz to 4.3ghz. After trying some more power demanding games the temp could still not pass 50c and stays quiet and cool to touch. It normally stays idle around 41c when not under a heavy load with no sound from the fans. The screen is decent quality but not meant for games since it's LCD and not being led the games get a bit of blur here and there with higher fps. Word of advice is when installing a different operating system the WiFi drivers do not reinstall with the system so any online activation is almost useless unless you have a usb-ethernet adapter. The battery lasts me around 6 hours in performance mode but in power saving mode could possibly last 9+ hours and way longer with some power setting tweaks. The graphics says 600mb dedicated and 3400mb shared but unlike a lot of systems all the shared moves straight to dedicated making it 4gb for the graphics. The value is pretty good and the appearance is slick. My older brother was checking it out and thinking of buying one now because of how well it does. Some upgrades to look into if you know what your doing is a new m.2 drive with a faster transfer rate and also possibly an upgraded 15.6inch screen that's 1080p-4k."

Nope. That feature is stupid in a laptop, in my view. As you use the keyboard, incidental touche s of the screen change focus or move to different screens--touchscreen is a gimmick and sucks.The screen on this laptop is worth the price by itself. Gorgeous, black is actually black, it rivals my AOC gaming desktop monitor.The Ryzen chip inside can be overclosked if you feel like it, but it is not needed. It is plenty fast for a laptop.This is set up to add memory and a hard drive. Do so. I spent an additional $50 to add a 1tb drive and an 8gig memory stick.  In so doing, I have the same specs as a $700 consumer laptop.Gaming? I stream from my desktop, it's perfect. It won't run any modern games at more than low settings (if that) but you don't need to run them onboard if you have a gaming machine. DO NOT BUY THIS TO PLAY GAMES ONBOARD. Stream via Steam, it's perfect.Buy this for $300, spend an additional $50 or $100 on memory and storage, and sit back and realize that you got a premier laptop for 1/3 the money people are spending on nothing.Build quality is bomber. Eveything is solid, no rattles, no warps. Others have ripped on the touchpad--can't tell the difference between this and any other laptop touchpad. It isn't loose, responds as usual, no problem.The screen is GORGEOUS and much better than laptops at twice or three times the price.I actually like the compressed number pad on the right. If you aren't doing a lot of 10-key stuff, it's what you need.The keyboard backlight stays on while you're typing, shuts off when you aren't. Perfectly configured.This boots in about 15 seconds.It has some heft, but is still very light. Hard to describe, but you can carry this all day in your backpack and not even know it is there. The power brick is about the size of a Toblerone tube. I plan on buying an extra to travel with.This will work as a consumer laptop as is, like I said, but add some memory and a hard drive and you are CRUSHING.I can't sing the praises of this enough.Buy this, add a drive and a memory stick and you get a premier laptop for less than $400. And you get a better screen, too. And anyone can do that, it isn't tough at all. If you can turn a screwdriver, you can update this machine.Make sure to go in and turn S mode off. First, activate Windows, then go to the store and turn off S mode.This is much better than what other companies are offering as a budget laptop."

The first thing I did was pull the stock memory and storage. I added 16 GB ram and put in 1 tb drives. I installed  Xubuntu Linux, later installed Debian Linux “bookworm” Release. with no driver issues. I added a USB 1 GB Ethernet adapter/hub combo to the 1 USB 3.1 port. This Laptop has a good screen and I like its lighted keyboard. Its Ryzen 3 3200U processor isn't fast, but its fast enough for my needs. I only use this laptop as a VPN internet share laptop for my work at home 2nd local area network. I could use an VPN router for this, but would get much slower internet speeds.  Using the laptop as an VPN share device I always get good internet speeds.  The second laptop I have as a backup, if the Linux OS gets a bad update and fails. It has happened 3 or 4 times where I had to use the backup laptop.  Minimal downtime that way. Always good to have a backup.The only thing I don't like about the laptop is that every so often I will get a blinking battery warning light. When that happens I unplug the ac power to the laptop and let the battery run down to 15%, then plug in the ac power to the laptop and good to go. No more warning light. I pull the bottom cover off once a year to clean the laptop and make sure the battery isn't showing signs of swelling. So far so good.  If that happened I would probably just pull the battery and run the laptop without a battery.  These laptops have been a good value for what I use them for. The laptop performs well running Linux, I would not be running windows on the laptop. I think its processor might be to slow for that. In its stock configuration 4 GB of ram would be a bad day for windows."

Here are my thoughts:Pros:Video Quality: The Full HD 1080p resolution is impressive. My video calls look clear and professional, which is great for both meetings and streaming.Auto-Light Balance: This feature is a lifesaver. It automatically adjusts the lighting, so I always look well-lit, even in dim or overly bright environments.Built-In Microphone: The built-in mic captures my voice clearly, which means I don't need an external microphone for most calls. It's convenient and keeps my desk less cluttered.Privacy Shutter: I really appreciate the integrated privacy shutter. It gives me peace of mind knowing I can easily cover the camera when I'm not using it.Easy Setup: It's truly plug-and-play. I just connected it via USB-A, and it worked seamlessly with all my video conferencing apps like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet.Cons:Zoom Capabilities: It doesn't have advanced zoom features, which might be a downside if you need to zoom in frequently during calls.No 4K Resolution: While 1080p is great, some might miss having a 4K option for even higher video quality.Requires USB-A Port: If your device only has USB-C ports, you'll need an adapter, which can be a bit inconvenient.Overall, the Logitech Brio 101 is a solid webcam that offers excellent video quality and useful features for both professional and casual use. It's been a reliable tool for my virtual meetings and streaming sessions."

I upgraded from a 720 resolution webcam and the image is significantly clearer.  As with any webcam, make the room as bright as possible, although this one does a decent job in low light.  Also like that this webcam has a narrower viewpoint than other webcams. I have a home office and want my image to take up most of the frame rather than showing the clutter around me in the office.Any external webcam is going to do a much better job than the webcam built into your laptop and it's not just about resolution it's about how it handles the shadows and bright spots.  Also, the built-in mic is much better than my laptop's mic.  Also, you can position an external webcam anywhere you want to.  Nothing worse than using a laptop webcam and having to look down onto the camera. By having it on top of the monitor, the image is much more professional looking.  I'm perfectly happy with this webcam but if I wanted better quality, I would get an actual photography camera that's designed to use as a webcam because I don't think you'd see a difference by just spending more on a webcam.Regarding the privacy slide on any webcam, yes it does work but the issue is that when you slide it, the camera might slide sideways Just use a small piece of cloth or paper and hinge it with a piece of tape and flip it out of the way when you want to use or not use it.I do give it five stars but did want to mention one criticism.  I wish this webcam had a tripod thread and also a ball socket to adjust the camera to any position.  This one only lets you adjust it up/down and not left to right and also a bit annoyed that the camera blocks the top row of my screen when using the built in kickstand.  Both of these problems easily solved by folding up the kickstand and using velcro to attach the bottom of the kickstand to the top of the monitor."
